# Developer Guide

#Introduction

CardLI is a Command Line Interface (CLI) desktop app designed to help students manage their flashcards. CardLI can help
students keep track of all their flashcards. It also does tests for students to test their knowledge. All of this in one
single platform.

## Design
CardLi has one main component, ```Duke```, which is the entry point to the App.

The rest of the App consists of the following components:
* ```Parser```: Interfaces with the user by reading and interpreting input
* ```UI```: The UI of the App
* ```Logic```: The command executor
* ```Storage```: Reads and writes data from and to an external file(s)

Each component is explained in the sections below.


### Parser Component
The Parser component consists of two classes, ```Parser``` and ```TestParser```. Parser deals with input relating to adding, deleting, editing and viewing flashcards and decks, while ```TestParser``` deals with input relating to testing.

How the Parser component works:
* Identifies the command input by the user
* Parses command arguments
* Executes commands using the Logic component
* Handles exceptions relating to invalid arguments

### UI Component
The UI component consists of two classes, ```CardLiUi``` and ```TestUi```. It outputs greeting, exit and help messages to the user on command.

### Logic Component
The Logic component consists of the classes ```DeckManager```, ```Deck```, ```Flashcard```, ```TestManager```, ```AnswerList``` and ```Answer```. It executes user commands by calling on methods in its classes when appropriate with the appropriate arguments as given by the Parser component.

CardLiâ€™s user commands operate on a 2-tier structure: a Systemwide level and a Deck level. The Systemwide level commands execute commands related to the management of decks, while the Deck level commands execute commands related to flashcards in a specific deck. The specific implementations are elaborated on in the *Implementation* section.

### Storage Component
The Storage component:
* Saves all the decks
* Saves all the flashcards
* Remembers which deck each flashcard belongs to
* Saves the results of each test

## Implementation
### Editing a Deck

This subsection provides details on the implementation of the commands that enable the editing of the `Deck` object.

The user can only edit the `name` attribute of the `Deck` object, which represents the name of the deck.

### `EditDeckCommand`
The 'EditDeckCommand' allows the changing of the name of the `Deck`.

Given below is the sequence diagram for `EditDeckCommand`:
![](assets/editDeckCommandSeqDiagram.png)

### Editing a FlashCard

The 'EditCardCommand' allows the changing of the content of the `FlashCard`. The user can decide to change either the `front`
or `back` attributes of the `FlashCard`object, which represents the front and back side of the card.

Given below is the sequence diagram for `EditCardCommand`:

###Test Feature
![class diagram](../docs/assets/testClassDiagram.png)

Currently, test feature is implemented on a systemwide level and is handled by `TestManager`.
`TestManager` will call on `TestUi` and `TestParser` to handle the inputs and outputs with the user
and the parsing respectively during the test.

At the start of the test, the user will choose to test themselves with a single deck or all decks at once.
This is dependent on the integer the user inputs.

In both cases, `TestManager` will create an `AnswerList` using a `Deck` that it creates or gets from
`DeckManager` depending on the condition which is shown by the sequence diagram below. The `AnswerList`
is where the user's response to the test is stored, and it is made up of `Answer` as shown in the class
diagram above.

![sequence diagram](../docs/assets/getTestDeckSequenceDiagram.png)

After initializing the `AnswerList`, the testing begins. The `Deck` gets shuffled, then
the user will answer the question one at a time. This process is repeated for the entire `Deck` that
is being tested which is shown below by the sequence diagram.

![sequence diagram](../docs/assets/testAllCardsShuffledSequenceDiagram.png)

After all cards have been tested, the marking process begins as shown by the sequence diagram below.
For every correct answer, the user's score increments and `TestUi` will print a correct answer message.
After marking all the questions, the user's results will be printed and saved in `TestHistory`.

![sequence diagram](../docs/assets/markTestSequenceDiagram.png)

### Storage

This feature allows users of CardLI to save data on their current decks of flashcards as well as
the tests that they have completed thus far. This will also allow users to re-access the data
when they re-enter the application. This way, they will not have to keep re-adding the same flashcards,
while also being able to review tests that they had previously done on the application. 

This feature is implemented by saving the userâ€™s data into two separate text files, which will be saved into
a new `data` directory created upon first start up of the application if it does not yet exist. 
This new directory will be created within the current directory from which the `CardLI.jar` file is run in the CLI. 
The file paths of the two text files are hard coded as `Cards_CardLI.txt` and `Tests_CardLItxt`, which will save data
on the user's decks of flashcards and test history respectively. 
When the user inputs the command `bye`, the application execute the save functions. When the 
user restarts or re-enters the application, the application will parse the text files and convert them into
the relevant data. The format of how the data is saved into the text files are specified 
during the development process in order to reduce the risk of bugs arising when the text files are being parsed, which
will be explained in the following paragraphs.

A `Storage` class was implemented to contain all the methods to execute the save and parse functions to and from the 
relevant text files. An instance of this class is created upon first start up the application to handle all the 
method calls. The respective methods will be explained in more detail in the following paragraphs.

`writeToFile(ArrayList<T> arrayList, String type)`

This method invoke the save function by writing the user's data to the specified text files. It takes in two arguments,
namely an `ArrayList` of a generic type `<T>` as well as a `String` denoting the `type` of data being saved.

For the saving of the user's decks of flashcards, the method call will expect an `ArrayList` of `Deck` objects along 
with a `type` argument of "cards". 
The `toString()` methods within the `Deck`and `Flashcard` classes have been overridden as per the specified format
of saving the decks of flashcards to the text file. 
For a `Flashcard` instance, the `toString()` method outputs a formatted string: `<front> | <back> | <userScore> 
| <totalScore>`. For a `Deck` instance, the `toString()` method also outputs a formatted string containing information 
about the deck name, the number of flashcards within the deck, on top of information on each of the flashcards contained
within the deck. An example of the format of the `Cards_CardLI.txt` where the decks of flashcards are saved is shown 
in the screenshot below.

For the saving of the user's test history, the method call will expect an `ArrayList` of `AnswerList` objects along
with a `type` argument of "tests".
The `toString()` methods within the `AnswerList`and `Answer` classes have been overridden as per the specified format
of saving the test history to the text file.
For a `Answer` instance, the `toString()` method outputs a formatted string: `<answer> | <questionIndex>`. 
For a `AnswerList` instance, the `toString()` method also outputs a formatted string containing information
about the test deck and the user's test score, on top of information on each of the user's answers for the test. 
An example of the format of the `Tests_CardLI.txt` where the decks of flashcards are saved is shown
in the screenshot below.

//TODO insert ss of Tests.CardLI.txt

`readCardsFromFile()` and `readTestsFromFile()`

These two methods are executed every time the CardLI application is opened.
The methods use an instance of the `Scanner` class to parse through the text files. 
As per the saving format explained in the `writeToFile()` method above, the 
`readCardsFromFile()`/`readTestsFromFile()` methods essentially reverse engineer the process to save the user's 
data into the application before any commands are given from the user.
