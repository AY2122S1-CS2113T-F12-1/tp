# User Guide

## Introduction


CardLI is a desktop app that helps you create, organise, and review flashcards via a Command Line 
Interface. As students ourselves, we find that studying through the use of flashcards can greatly
increase the efficacy of our study sessions as they break down large chapters and concepts into 
easy-to-understand segments. Hence, CardLI was designed in order to help students study better 
through the use of flashcards, while also reducing the paper waste that goes into writing physical
flashcards. The interfacing within the application is designed to be interactive and functional,
while the commands are designed to be intuitive to use. 

## How To Use The Guide

## Quick Start

1. Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed.
2. Down the latest version of `CardLI.jar` from [here](http://link.to/duke).
3. Take note of the full filepath of directory in which `CardLI.jar` is saved.
4. Open the command prompt by searching `cmd` in the search bar.
5. Navigate to the file directory containing `CardLI.jar` using the command `cd <filepath>`.
6. Start up CardLI using the command``java -jar CardLI.jar`.

The above steps are for users who are running CardLI on a Windows device. If you are using an Apple
and Linux device, you will have to open the command prompt equivalent on your operating system in step 4. 
Subsequently, you will also have to use the equivalent command on your operating system for 
navigation to a file directory in step 5. The remaining steps are the same across all operating systems.

## Features 
The current version of CardLI has two menus: main and deck. In the main menu, you are working with
all the decks, so commands only apply to the decks and not the individual flashcards. Enter the deck
menu to work with the flashcards.

### Testing flashcards within a deck: `test`

Enter test mode. The program will ask you to input the index for the deck that is to be tested.
The word to be tested will be displayed in the console. 
Typing the exact character-for-character definition for the word will result in a correct answer. 
Otherwise, the response will be marked as incorrect. Regardless of whether the answer is correct 
or incorrect, the console will then display the next word to be tested. When all cards in the deck 
have been tested, the percentage of correct answers will be displayed in the console, as well as the 
cards which received incorrect responses.

If you do not know the answer to the current question being tested, and you want to skip to another
question, you can do so by typing `/NEXT` or `/BACK` when prompted with the test question. 

`/NEXT` will skip to the next question while `/BACK` will go back to the previous question tested.
> ‚ùó Test data is not saved until a test is complete. If the program crashes mid-test, the data for that test will not be saved.

Format: `test`

## FAQs

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer? 

**A**: In order to transfer the data on your decks of flashcards to another computer, simply transfer
the `data` file directory to your other computer, and download the latest version of CardLI there. 
The `data` file directory should contain both the `Cards_CardLI.json` and `Tests_CardLI.json` files. 
Ensure that both the `data` file directory and `CardLI.jar` file are in the **same directory** before running
the CardLI application in the command prompt as instructed under the Quick Start section. 

**Q**: Can I directly edit the storage JSON files to make changes to my saved data?

**A**: We highly recommend that users who are unfamiliar with the workings of JSON and the
format of the saved data do not attempt to directly edit the storage JSON files. This is because the CardLI 
application has been programmed to read a specified format from the JSON files.
Any inaccuracies arising from the direct editing of the files will likely lead to undesirable consequences such as 
bugs and possible loss of your saved data if the files cannot be reverted to their original format.
Nonetheless, it is still possible to directly make edits to the storage JSON files if you are confidant in maintaining
the format integrity of the files.
