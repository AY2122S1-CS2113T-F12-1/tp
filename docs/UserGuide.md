# User Guide

## Introduction


CardLI is a desktop app that helps you create, organise, and review flashcards via a Command Line 
Interface. As students ourselves, we find that studying through the use of flashcards can greatly
increase the efficacy of our study sessions as they break down large chapters and concepts into 
easy-to-understand segments. Hence, CardLI was designed in order to help students study better 
through the use of flashcards, while also reducing the paper waste that goes into writing physical
flashcards. The interfacing within the application is designed to be interactive and functional,
while the commands are designed to be intuitive to use. 


## How To Use

This guide is meant to help you to get familiarised with all the features of CardLI. The `Quick Start`
section will tell you how to download and get CardLI set up. The `Features` section provides an
in depth description of all available features, which you can refer to if you to know the exact definitions. 
There is also a `Command Summary` section that will give you a brief overview of the format of all
commands and an example in table format to make it easier for you to navigate.

## Quick Start

1. Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed.
2. Down the latest version of `CardLI.jar` from [here](http://link.to/duke).
3. Take note of the full filepath of directory in which `CardLI.jar` is saved.
4. Open the command prompt by searching `cmd` in the search bar.
5. Navigate to the file directory containing `CardLI.jar` using the command `cd <filepath>`.
6. Start up CardLI using the command``java -jar CardLI.jar`.

The above steps are for users who are running CardLI on a Windows device. If you are using an Apple
and Linux device, you will have to open the command prompt equivalent on your operating system in step 4. 
Subsequently, you will also have to use the equivalent command on your operating system for 
navigation to a file directory in step 5. The remaining steps are the same across all operating systems.

## Features 
The current version of CardLI has two menus: main and deck. In the main menu, you are working with
all the decks, so commands only apply to the decks and not the individual flashcards. Enter the deck
menu to work with the flashcards.

Enter test mode. The program will ask you to input the index for the deck that is to be tested.
The word to be tested will be displayed in the console. 
Typing the exact character-for-character definition for the word will result in a correct answer. 
Otherwise, the response will be marked as incorrect. Regardless of whether the answer is correct 
or incorrect, the console will then display the next word to be tested. When all cards in the deck 
have been tested, the percentage of correct answers will be displayed in the console, as well as the 
cards which received incorrect responses.

If you do not know the answer to the current question being tested, and you want to skip to another
question, you can do so by typing `/NEXT` or `/BACK` when prompted with the test question. 

`/NEXT` will skip to the next question while `/BACK` will go back to the previous question tested.

## [3. FAQs](#content)

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer? 

**A**: In order to transfer the data on your decks of flashcards to another computer, simply transfer
the `CardLI.txt` file to your other computer, and download the latest version of CardLI there. 
Ensure that both the `CardLI.txt` and `CardLI.jar` files are in the **same directory** before running
the CardLI application in the command prompt as instructed under the Quick Start section. 

**Q**: Can I directly edit the `CardLI.txt` file to add, edit or delete decks and flashcards?

**A**: If you are familiar with the format of how the decks and flashcards are saved within the text
file, you are free to do so. However, if errors are generated upon the next start up of the CardLI 
application, you are advised to revert all changes to the text file and make the necessary changes
from within the application. We will only recommend this method if you are a veteran user and have a
good grasp of the application.
