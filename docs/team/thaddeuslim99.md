### Project: CardLI

CardLI is a desktop app that helps you create, organise, and review flashcards via a Command Line
Interface. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to edit card content and deck name.
    * What it does: Allows the user to change the front and back of a card, as well as the name of decks.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands 
  and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
    
* **New Feature**: Added the ability to move a card from one deck to another.
  * What it does: Allows the user to transfer a card from one deck to another.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in placing a card in
    a certain deck and may wish to move it to another deck in a convinient way rather than having to delete the card and
  add the card in another deck.

* **New Feature**: Basic Testing.
  * What it does: Through creating the initial Answer, AnswerList and TestManager classes, users can test his/her
  knowledge with the flashcards.
  * Justification: This feature is essential to the product as the purpose of flashcards is to test oneself with them.

* **New Feature**: Skip question capability in tests.
  * What it does: Added the ability to skip a question during tests.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as a user may not know the answer to a flashcard
  and may want to come back to the question later.

* **New Feature**: Added help command.
  * What it does: Added the ability to ask for the list of commands.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as a user may not want to refer to the user guide
  for instructions.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link]()

* **Project management**:
    * Managed milestone V1.0 and V2.1
    * Ensured tracker progress for V2.0 and V2.1

* **Enhancements to existing features**:

        * Added implementation details of the `edit` feature (for both cards and deck).
        * Added implementation details of the `move` feature.
        * Added target audience.

* **Community**:
    * PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): [\#12](), [\#32](), [\#19](), [\#42]()
    * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples: [1](), [2](), [3]())
