#### Enhancements Implemented

1. Adding and deleting of flashcards

These functions add and delete flashcards from the deck. 

2. Adding of decks

This function allows multiple decks to be managed by the program.

3. Inner Parser

The inner parser handles all commands in deck mode, separate from the parser handling the commands in the main menu.

4. Flashcard search

This function searches for and displays flashcards matching the search term input by the user. It allows the user to find certain flashcards without entering each deck and manually looking through all the flashcards. The function is not case-sensitive.

5. JUnit Testing

Wrote tests for JUnit for add and delete flashcard functions
#### Contributions to the UG

Added screenshots to show sample output of the commands. Wrote `find`, `help` and `bye` sections. Wrote command summary. Edited descriptions and format of commands for consistency.
#### Contributions to the DG

Wrote and constructed architecture diagrams for overall architecture, model component, logic component. Wrote design details and constructed sequence diagram under `find`. 
#### Contributions to team-based tasks

Documented user stories in DG.
